# OpenGL_IK_CCD_3D
Trinity College Dublin, Real-time Animation Assignment - CCD algorithm for 3D inverse kinematics. The algorithm can also work well in 2D dimension situations. 

The 3D version has more control over the camera compared to 2D, and some small animations. The same CCD algorithm is used for calculating IK, and adding bones is the same as in the 2D version.

### Keyboard AWSD with the left mouse button
Control the camera position and viewing angle.

### Right mouse button
Choose the position where the end effector should go.

### Press Enter
The bone chain goes into spring mode, no matter right-click to drag the bone to any position of any shape, the bone chain will spring back to a fixed position (spring back speed and position can be set by yourself).

### Press Space
Animation mode (ease-in and ease-out).
